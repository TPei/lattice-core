module Lattice::Connected

  # A cohort of WebObject used to create a client-server connection between a server-hosted
  # object (WebObject) and a client DOM-representation of that object.  To make the
  # as seamless as possible, with updates and actions ocurring as an event model on *both* sides
  # of the connection.
  #
  # In order to identify a particular user (which we do via an http session), we must
  # tie a socket to a session, and sockets subscribe to WebObjects.  Each
  # connected_object keeps track of its subscribers (via an HTTP::WebSocket) which it can use for
  # communication.  
  # 
  # This class in particular maintains an array that links a HTTP::WebSocket object_id to a 
  # Session id in WebSocket::REGISTERED_SESSIONS.
  # It handles incoming communication on the socket, establishes socket-session relationships,
  # registerers subscriptions to objects received over the socket, and forwards messages to
  # individual objects when received from a subscriber. 
  #
  # This is all done at the class level - no WebSocket instances are created
  # 
  # An important note on incoming messages:  This class has a very specific, simple rule
  # for sending commands:  the command is the key, and the value is the payload.  The 
  # system accepts only one command per message; the first key and value are used as that command.
  #
  # WebSocket is not instantiated, but acts as a conduit for connecting individual HTTP::WebSockets
  # to instantiated WebObjects.
  # 
  # REGISTERED_SESSIONS contains all known active sockets along with their associated
  # session_id in a Hash(UInt64=>String), where socket's object_id is the key, and the
  # session_id string is the value.  Ultimately, we have to be able to associated 
  # sessions with sockets, and this is the most direct means and the logical place,
  #
  # Our ClientServer API's entry point is on_message, which is called whenever a new
  # data comes in across the socket.  This data is, by definition, an aribrary string,
  # but since the endpoint is known and only promises to handle this API, we shouldn't
  # expect anything other then incoming ClientServer API messages.  
  # 
  # The incoming messages are validated and packaged by validate_payload, which does all
  # the "heavy lifting" - it identifies the instantiated object and creates a reference to it,
  # finds the associated session (if one exists) and supplies the session_id string, 
  # and pacakges those items in an object that also contains the params of the incoming messages.
  # 
  # The incoming messages, which is the ClientServer API, is a very specifically-formatted
  # object with a single key and a value object that has action and param keys.  The example
  # below shows clicking on a card in a card_game:
  # 
  #```
  # incoming messsage = {
  # "cardgame-93893329349200-card-0": {
  #   "action":"click",
  #   "params": {
  #     "src":"/images/ace_of_clubs.png" }
  # }
  abstract class WebSocket


    # VALID_ACTIONS = %w(subscribe click input mouse submit)

    REGISTERED_SESSIONS = {} of UInt64=>String

    # validate_payload takes incoming message, parses it as JSON,
    # and processes it according to the ClientServer API.  The key
    # of the message is the data-item dom element that is the subject
    # of the message, and the value is an object with an action and parameters.
    # the action key of params is a string, generally maps to the javascript
    # equivalen event when possible (those used by javascripts' addEventHandler).
    # Currently, click, mouseenter, mouseleave, submit and input events are defined.
    # incoming params are not checked for validity, and their values are entirely dependent
    # on the javascript on the client (as defined in app.js).
    # Two example incoming messages are below:
    #```
    # # example subscribe message
    # {
    #   "cardgame-93972704197200": {
    #     "action":"subscribe",
    #     "params": {
    #       "session_id":"d1a602d22520ce3308427eee55376461"
    #     }
    #   }
    # }
    #
    # # example clicking a card in card_game
    # {
    #   "cardgame-93893329349200-card-0": {
    #     "action":"click",
    #     "params": {
    #       "src":"/images/ace_of_clubs.png" 
    #      }
    # }
    #```
    # Once parsed, the the key is used to identify and instantiate a WebObject,
    # If a session has previously been registered with a socket, the session_id
    # is identified.
    # These results are packaged into an object; for example, the previous
    # incoming `click` example is processed into this:
    # ```
    # {
    #   "dom_item"    => "cardgame-93893329349200-card-0 ,
    #   "session_id"  => "d1a602d22520ce3308427eee55376461",
