module Lattice::Connected

  # A cohort of WebObject used to create a client-server connection between a server-hosted
  # object (WebObject) and a client DOM-representation of that object.  To make the
  # as seamless as possible, with updates and actions ocurring as an event model on *both* sides
  # of the connection.
  #
  # In order to identify a particular user (which we do via an http session), we must
  # tie a socket to a session, and sockets subscribe to WebObjects.  Each
  # connected_object keeps track of its subscribers (via an HTTP::WebSocket) which it can use for
  # communication.  
  # 
  # This class in particular maintains an array that links a HTTP::WebSocket object_id to a 
  # Session id in WebSocket::REGISTERED_SESSIONS.
  # It handles incoming communication on the socket, establishes socket-session relationships,
  # registerers subscriptions to objects received over the socket, and forwards messages to
  # individual objects when received from a subscriber. 
  #
  # This is all done at the class level - no WebSocket instances are created
  # 
  # An important note on incoming messages:  This class has a very specific, simple rule
  # for sending commands:  the command is the key, and the value is the payload.  The 
  # system accepts only one command per message; the first key and value are used as that command.
